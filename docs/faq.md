# Frequently Asked Questions
## Functionality
### Why is information about pages stored in a source code?
1. It's easier that way. 
2. The user will be motivated to add his code to the main branch of the project (create issues and pull requests). This allows all users of the program to use this data.

### Are there plans to add the ability to work with other APIs?
No. It would break the simplicity of the program.
I try to adhere to the UNIX principle: program does one thing, but it does it well.
