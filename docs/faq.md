# Frequently Asked Questions
## Why is there no support for Windows?
There are several reasons for this:
1. I do not support proprietary software. And I'm not going to help users who use it.
2. Windows is not POSIX compliant.

You can try to build a program for this operating system.
But it may not work at all or it may not work as intended.


## Why is information about pages stored in a source code?
1. It's easier that way. 
2. The user will be motivated to add his code to the main branch of the project (create issues and pull requests). This allows all users of the program to use this data.


## Are there plans to add the ability to work with other APIs?
No. It would break the simplicity of the program.
I try to adhere to the UNIX principle: program does one thing, but it does it well.
